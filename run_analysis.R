## Getting and Cleaning Data 
## Course Project
## Santiago Oleas

## INSTRUCTIONS
## You will be required to submit: 
##     (1) a tidy data set as described below
##     (2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing 
##         the analysis
##     (3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
##         transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 
##         called CodeBook.md. 
##     (4) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
##         This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are 
##         connected.  

## This file addresses what was requested in (1) above
## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the 
## following. 
## Req 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Req 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
##         for each measurement. 
## Req 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Req 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## Req 5 - From the data set in Step 4, creates a second, independent tidy 
##         data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
##         subject.

## Load important libraries
        library(dplyr)

## Get data from Internet
        #Get file
        fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" 
        download.file(fileURL, destfile = "motionData.zip", method = "curl")

        ##Unzip file
        unzip("motionData.zip",overwrite=TRUE)

## Req 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Req 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
##         I will do requirement 1 and 4 in this section of code by combining
##         data sets with the appropriate variable names
        
        ##Observing the unzipped file I see that we now have a nest of folders that looks like:
        ## ./UCI HAR Dataset/
        ##      contains files 
        ##      - activity_labels.txt ***IMPORTANT*** This maps to other data sets
        ##      - features_info.txt   ***Describes data field types. Important for answering 
        ##                               further questions
        ##      - features.txt        ***IMPORTANT*** These are the "column" names for both sets
        ##                               of X_test.txt and X_train.txt data
        ##      - README.txt          ***Overview doc
        
        ## ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/
        ##      contains files
        ##      - subject_test.txt
        ##      - X_test.txt
        ##      - y_test
        ## ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals ***Can be ignored
        
        ## ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/
        ##      contains files
        ##      - subject_train.txt
        ##      - X_train.txt
        ##      - y_train
        ## ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Inertial Signals ***Can be ignored

        ## Each of train and test has 3 data files that must be combined.  They
        ## appear to be 3 different sets of data sets pertaining to the same 
        ## observations
        ## "subject_*.txt" has the ID of the subject while the observation took
        ##                 place
        ## "X_*.txt"       has the actual observations.  There are no COLUMN  
        ##                 names here, these can be found in the "features.txt"
        ## "y_*.txt"       has the activiy label IDs.  These can later be 
        ##                 joined with activity_labels.txt to know which 
        ##                 activity we are dealing with
        
        ## So this is how we have to put this together. Picture these like blocks 
        ## that we either stack on top of or put next to each other. In some cases
        ## we force a label eg, subject_id or we force a column value ("train"
        ## and "test" to differentiate the data source)
        ## ["group"]["subject_id"     ]["activity_id"][features.txt$description]
        ## ["train"][subject_test.txt ][y_test.txt   ][X_test.txt  ]
        ## ["test" ][subject_train.txt][y_train.txt  ][X_train.txt ]
        
        ## The sample data will look something like this after we are done 
        ## (assume comma separated)
        ## group, subject_id, activity_id, tBodyAcc-mean()-X, tBodyAcc-mean()-Y, ..., angle(Z,gravityMean)
        ## train, 1,          5,           2.8858451e-001,    -2.0294171e-02, ...,    -5.8626924E-02
        ## ...
        ## test,  2,          5,           2.5717778e-001,    -2.3285230e-002, ...,   -6.7430222e-001
        
        ## gather general data
        ## NB - when provided with more than one column the separator is
        ##      the empty string "" and not a space " ".  When the " "
        ##      space was used, it produced errors but "" worked fine
                
                ##features

                ## get reading data
                ## the column names come from features$featureDesc so we assign

                        ## special characters ended up with periods. Example:
                        ## tBodyAcc.mean...X.  We will use gsub to replace the column

                #Finally we will append a single column called group
                #that will have the value 'test' for all rows.
                #This will be necessary later when we combine 'test'

                ## get reading data
                ## the column names come from features$featureDesc so we assign

                ##COMBINE train data into a single data frame
                train <- cbind(trainSubject,trainActivity,trainReadings)

                #confirmed 10299.Good
        ###
        ### This concludes Requirement 1.
        ### motionData successfully has a combination of test and train data
        ###

## Req 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
##         for each measurement.
        ## We need to keep the key varibles as well.  That includes:
        ## - group
        ## - subjectID
        ## - activityID
        ## - all mean measurements:  contains("mean")
        ## - all standard deviation measurements:  contains('std')
        ## - exclude 'meanFreq' since that is not the same as mean: -contains('meanFreq')
        ## We will use dplyr's SELECT function usig the above list
        motionDataMeanSTD <- select(motionData,group,subjectID,activityID,contains('mean'),contains('std'),-contains('meanFreq'))

        ###
        ### This concludes Requirement 2.
        ### motionDataMeanSTD successfully has the key variables and all 
        ### mean() and std() columns
        ###
        
        

## Req 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
##         data set
        ## We can use the merge command to combine the activities and the
        ## motionDataMeanSTD data frames.  They both have activityID.
        ## We will get activities$activityDesc, which is what we need to 
        ## include to fulfill the requirements for this requirement
        motionDataMeanSTDActivity <- merge(activities, motionDataMeanSTD, by.x = "activityID", by.y = "activityID", all=TRUE)
        
        ## We can now drop the original activityID since we are using
        ## activityDesc
        ## We will use -activityID meaning everything except activityID
        motionDataMeanSTDActivity <- select(motionDataMeanSTDActivity,-activityID)
        
        ## Let us check that we have the activityDesc
        head(select(motionDataMeanSTDActivity,activityDesc,group, subjectID),5)
        
        #   activityDesc group subjectID
        # 1      WALKING train        26
        # 2      WALKING train        29
        # 3      WALKING train        29
        # 4      WALKING train        29
        # 5      WALKING train        29
        
        # looks good
        
        ###
        ### This concludes Requirement 3.
        ### motionDataMeanSTDActivity successfully has activity names
        ###
        
## Req 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        ## I actually took care of this during Requirement 1 when I had loaded
        ## the data frame 'features' from the features.txt and used the 
        ## description variable features$featureDesc as the col.names argument
        ## when loading both X_train.txt and X_test.txt files
        
        names(motionDataMeanSTDActivity)
        ## We clearly see variables/columns are all labeled
        
## Req 5 - From the data set in Step 4, creates a second, independent tidy 
##         data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
##         subject.
        ## Since we need an average of each variable for each activity and subject
        ## this means we can safely exclude 'group', the variable used to distinguish
        ## between 'test' and 'train' data observations.
        ## Using the dplyr chaining commands (%>%) we will do this
        ## one step at a time
        ##      - get all columns except group because we want to be left with
        ##        activity, subject and all measurements but not group
        ##      - group by activity and subject since we need to summarize on this
        ##      - find the mean of each measurement against our group using the
        ##        summarise_all() function call with an argument of funs(mean)
        ##        meaning that we want the mean of each measurement
        motionDataMeanSummary <- motionDataMeanSTDActivity %>% 
                                   select(-group) %>% 
                                   group_by(activityDesc,subjectID) %>%
                                   summarise_each(funs(mean))
        
        ## We must extract this file
        write.table(motionDataMeanSummary, "step5Output.txt",row.names=FALSE)
        
        ###
        ### This concludes Requirement 5.
        ### tidy data has been produced and placed into a text file that was
        ### also uploaded to the Coursera Course Project site.
        ###
